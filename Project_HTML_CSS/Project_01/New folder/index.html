      <p>This my first work as html.i am trying to do my best to do well.<br>
        Dont know how many days it will take to learn prgramming stuffs.<br>
      But i am hoping for the best outcome. Focusing on the skills lets see how much i can learn from this.<br>

        As well as any games or more experiment stuff (which is what the web is really all about).
